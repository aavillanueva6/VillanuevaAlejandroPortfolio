# Alejandro Villanueva's Portfolio #
## Purpose and Functionality ##
This project holds links to relevant projects that I have completed, as well as holds links to my professional social media, and resume.  


Currently only two actual projects are added to the portfolio.  Additional placeholder projects are added to show site functionality when more projects have been completed.

## Key Learnings ##

* Site uses flex boxes and media queries to make it responsive and have consistent styling.
* Site uses pseudo classes to add effects while hovering over the project cards.  This allows for the images to be highlighted while hovered.
* Strengthened proficiency with html and css.  
* Created favicon by custom designing an .svg image.
    * Learned proper formatting for favicon images for Apple touch devices
    * (may still have some learning to do with Android devices.  I don't have one to test with.)
