# Alejandro Villanueva's Portfolio

## Purpose and Functionality

This project holds links to relevant projects that I have completed, as well as holds links to my professional social media, and resume.

The NPS Hike Search tool was a collaborative project. All other projects were developed individually by me.

## Key Learnings

- Site uses flex boxes and media queries to make it responsive and have consistent styling.
- Site uses pseudo classes to add effects while hovering over the project cards. This allows for the images to be highlighted while hovered.
- Strengthened proficiency with html and css.
- Created favicon by custom designing an .svg image.
  - Learned proper formatting for favicon images for Apple touch devices
  - (may still have some learning to do with Android devices. I don't have one to test with.)
